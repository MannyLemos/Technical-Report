# Technical-Report
A technical report on pointers in C created using LaTeX.
This report focuses on building a foundation of what pointers are and how they function in the C programming language. Various coding examples are employed to provide real implementations that can be followed along by the reader. The latter half of the report focuses on providing an abstract interpretation of pointers with the hope of evoking a deeper level of understanding.
